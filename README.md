# AI Agent for Data Analysis

A lightweight Streamlit application that automatically preprocesses, validates, and visualises tabular datasets. It integrates with AI models (via LangChain wrappers) to clean and infer insights from user data and provides an auto-dashboard for exploratory analysis.

The codebase is organised around modular helpers for ingestion, validation and visualization, plus a simple `Agent` class to orchestrate generative-model calls.


## 🚀 Features

- Upload CSV/JSON/XLSX/text datasets
- Preprocess and clean data using an AI agent
- Auto-generate descriptive statistics and plots with Plotly
- Visualise both raw and cleaned data
- Lightweight interface built with Streamlit
- No data or API keys are stored on the server(so you can share Api without taking any headache ^_^)

## 💻 Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

```bash
cd "your/project/path"
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Linux/macOS
# or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you add additional libraries in development, update `requirements.txt` accordingly.


## 🛠 Usage

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

A browser window will open. Use the sidebar to select a model, upload your dataset, and provide the API key for the chosen provider (e.g. Google Gemini, OpenAI).

- **Auto Data Visualizer**: upload a CSV and get instant charts without using the AI agent.
- **AI Agent Processing**: clean and analyse your dataset with generative models.

Files you upload are saved to `UserInputFiles/` for convenience; cleaned output appears in `cleanedDF/` and can be visualised immediately.
